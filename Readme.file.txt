1. Overall the project has 5 classes but we start with intially 2 classes for Capstone I.
2. We are using Convoulutional Neural Network since this algorithm is designed for image classifiction model.

Overall, the project has 5 classes which are to be implemented by the end of capstone II. To start with, we have gone through a complete notebook that describes the flow of CNN, to strengthen our knowledge about deep learning, CNNs and neural networks. We will apply the classification model for 2 classes in capstone I and will test it on a webÂ application. We are making deep understanding of deep learning and CNN now, and we will apply this technique on our dataset and we need almost 1 week to complete it.
